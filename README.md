# Penetrator

**Penetrator** is a Python-based project designed to assist with penetration testing, cybersecurity research, and related automation tasks. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates various techniques, tools, and methodologies relevant to ethical hacking and security testing.

---

## Features

- Automated security testing workflows.
- Scripts and notebooks for vulnerability scanning and analysis.
- Modular and easy-to-extend architecture.
- Visualization and reporting of security test results.

---

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Penetrator.git
cd Penetrator
````

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You can generate a `requirements.txt` from your notebook using: `!pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### 4. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the provided `.ipynb` file:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

---

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `Soumya Ai.ipynb` (or renamed file).
2. Follow the step-by-step cells to execute penetration testing modules.
3. Customize parameters such as target URLs, IPs, or payloads as per your needs.

---

## Example Outputs

* Security scan reports
* Vulnerability detection logs
* Data visualization charts for test results

*(Add screenshots or code snippets if you want to showcase sample outputs.)*

Do you want me to **extract the libraries and dependencies from your uploaded notebook** and generate a `requirements.txt` automatically to include it in the README?  
Also, should I add **badges (like GitHub stars, license, Python version)** to make it look even more professional?
```
